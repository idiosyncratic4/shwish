## Project Description

In today's pandemic hit world when everyone's medium of shopping has switched to online, primitive methods of checkouts have more than 3-minutes of waiting time.
We aim to significantly shorten this time by processing payments using user's voice profile, making it happen in a fraction of a minute. Furthermore, with the help of Azure Speech API, we aim to authenticate users using speech recognition.


## Instructions to run

* Install python dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

* Execute ```python3 app.py``` to start the app


## User Authentication and Identification

1. Azure Speaker Recognition API module - for better and easy user identification
2. Flask
3. Python
4. CosmosDB
5. Javascript
6. Azure VM

## Future Scope

* Making retail a more transparent and safer ground.

* Provide a supply chain to manage customer demands.

* Add an item recommendation system to advise customers on item needs based on buying trends.
